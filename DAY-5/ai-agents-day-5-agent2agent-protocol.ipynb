You'll learn how to integrate with external agent services and consume remote agents as if they were local.\n\nIn this notebook, you'll:\n\n- Understand the A2A protocol and when to use it vs sub-agents\n- Learn common A2A architecture patterns (cross-framework, cross-language, cross-organization)\n- Expose an ADK agent via A2A using `to_a2a()`\n- Consume remote agents using `RemoteA2aAgent`\n- Build a product catalog integration system\n\n\n\n\n## 📚 Overview of Agent2Agent (A2A)\n\n### 🤔 The Problem\n\nAs you build more complex AI systems, you'll find that:\n- **A single agent can't do everything** - Specialized agents for different domains work better\n- **You need agents to collaborate** - Customer support needs product data, order systems need inventory info\n- **Different teams build different agents** - You want to integrate agents from external vendors\n- **Agents may use different languages/frameworks** - You need a standard communication protocol\n\n### ✅ The Solution: A2A Protocol\n\nThe [Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol](https://a2a-protocol.org/) is a **standard** that allows agents to:\n- ✨ **Communicate over networks** - Agents can be on different machines\n- ✨ **Use each other's capabilities** - One agent can call another agent like a tool\n- ✨ **Work across frameworks** - Language/framework agnostic\n- ✨ **Maintain formal contracts** - Agent cards describe capabilities\n\n### 🏗️ Common A2A Architecture Patterns\n\nThe A2A protocol is particularly useful in three scenarios:\n\n![When to choose A2A?](https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day5/a2a_01.png)\n\n\n1. **Cross-Framework Integration**: ADK agent communicating with other agent frameworks\n2. **Cross-Language Communication**: Python agent calling Java or Node.js agent  \n3. **Cross-Organization Boundaries**: Your internal agent integrating with external vendor services\n\n### 📋 What This Notebook Demonstrates\n\nWe'll build a practical e-commerce integration:\n1. **Product Catalog Agent** (exposed via A2A) - External vendor service that provides product information\n2. **Customer Support Agent** (consumer) - Your internal agent that helps customers by querying product data\n\n```text\n┌──────────────────────┐           ┌──────────────────────┐\n│ Customer Support     │  ─A2A──▶  │ Product Catalog      │\n│ Agent (Consumer)     │           │ Agent (Vendor)       │\n│ Your Company         │           │ External Service     │\n│ (localhost:8000)     │           │ (localhost:8001)     │\n└──────────────────────┘           └──────────────────────┘\n```\n\n**Why this justifies A2A:**\n- Product Catalog is maintained by an external vendor (you can't modify their code)\n- Different organizations with separate systems\n- Formal contract needed between services\n- Product Catalog could be in a different language/framework\n\n### 💡 A2A vs Local Sub-Agents: Decision Table\n\n| Factor | Use A2A | Use Local Sub-Agents |\n|--------|---------|---------------------|\n| **Agent Location** | External service, different codebase | Same codebase, internal |\n| **Ownership** | Different team/organization | Your team |\n| **Network** | Agents on different machines | Same process/machine |\n| **Performance** | Network latency acceptable | Need low latency |\n| **Language/Framework** | Cross-language/framework needed | Same language |\n| **Contract** | Formal API contract required | Internal interface |\n| **Example** | External vendor product catalog | Internal order processing steps |\n\n### 📝 Tutorial Context\n\n**In this tutorial**, we'll simulate both agents locally (both running on localhost) for learning purposes. In production:\n- Product Catalog Agent would run on vendor's infrastructure (e.g., `https://vendor.com`)\n- Customer Support Agent would run on your infrastructure\n- They'd communicate over the internet using A2A protocol\n\nThis local simulation lets you learn A2A without needing to deploy services!\n\n---\n\n### 🔄 What We'll Build\n\nHere's a high-level view of the system architecture you'll create in this tutorial:\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day5/a2a_02.png)\n\n**How it works:**\n1. **Customer** asks a product question to your Customer Support Agent\n2. **Support Agent** realizes it needs product information\n3. **Support Agent** calls the **Product Catalog Agent** via A2A protocol\n4. **Product Catalog Agent** (external vendor) returns product data\n5. **Support Agent** formulates an answer and responds to the customer\n\n---\n\n### 🗺️ Tutorial Steps\n\nIn this tutorial, you'll complete **6 steps**:\n\n1. **Create the Product Catalog Agent** - Build the vendor's agent with product lookup\n2. **Expose via A2A** - Make it accessible using `to_a2a()`\n3. **Start the Server** - Run the agent as a background service\n4. **Create the Customer Support Agent** - Build the consumer agent\n5. **Test Communication** - See A2A in action with real queries\n6. **Understand the Flow** - Learn what happened behind the scenes\n\nLet's get started! 🚀","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Install dependencies\n\nThe Kaggle Notebooks environment includes a pre-installed version of the [google-adk](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/) library for Python and its required dependencies, so you don't need to install additional packages in this notebook.\n\nTo install and use ADK, including A2A and its dependencies, in your own Python development environment outside of this course, you can do so by running:\n\n```\npip install -q google-adk[a2a]\n```","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"pip install -q google-adk[a2a]","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-27T09:48:50.146273Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-27T09:48:50.146676Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-27T09:48:55.362124Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-27T09:48:50.146637Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-27T09:48:55.360851Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":2},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Configure your Gemini API Key\n\nThis notebook uses the [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/), which requires an API key.\n\n**1.

The A2A request was sent over HTTP to `http://localhost:8001` (highlighted in yellow)\n6. **Product Catalog Agent** (server) received the request and called `get_product_info(\"iPhone 15 Pro\")`\n7. **Product Catalog Agent** returned the product information via A2A response\n8. **RemoteA2aAgent** received the response and passed it back to the Support Agent\n9. **Support Agent** formulated a final answer with the product details\n10. **Customer** received the complete, helpful response\n\n### Key Benefits Demonstrated\n\n1. **Transparency**: Support Agent doesn't \"know\" Product Catalog Agent is remote\n2. **Standard Protocol**: Uses A2A standard - any A2A-compatible agent works\n3. **Easy Integration**: Just one line: `sub_agents=[remote_product_catalog_agent]`\n4. **Separation of Concerns**: Product data lives in Catalog Agent (vendor), support logic in Support Agent (your company)\n\n### Real-World Applications\n\nThis pattern enables:\n- **Microservices**: Each agent is an independent service\n- **Third-party Integration**: Consume agents from external vendors (e.g., product catalogs, payment processors)\n- **Cross-language**: Product Catalog Agent could be Java, Support Agent Python\n- **Specialized Teams**: Vendor maintains catalog, your team maintains support agent\n- **Cross-Organization**: Vendor hosts catalog on their infrastructure, you integrate via A2A","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 🎓 Next Steps and Learning Resources\n\n### 🚀 Enhancement Ideas\n\nNow that you understand A2A basics, try extending this example:\n\n1. **Add More Agents**:\n   - Create an **Inventory Agent** that checks stock levels and restocking schedules\n   - Create a **Shipping Agent** that provides delivery estimates and tracking\n   - Have Customer Support Agent coordinate all three via A2A\n\n2. **Real Data Sources**:\n   - Replace mock product catalog with real database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)\n   - Add real inventory tracking system integration\n   - Connect to real payment gateway APIs\n\n3. **Advanced A2A Features**:\n   - Implement authentication between agents (API keys, OAuth)\n   - Add error handling and retries for network failures\n   - Use the alternative `adk api_server --a2a` approach\n\n4. **Deploy to Production**:\n   - Deploy Product Catalog Agent to Agent Engine\n   - Update agent card URL to point to production server (e.g., `https://vendor-catalog.example.com`)\n   - Consumer agents can now access it over the internet!\n\n### 📚 Documentation\n\n**A2A Protocol**:\n\n- [Official A2A Protocol Website](https://a2a-protocol.org/)\n- [A2A Protocol Specification](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/spec/)\n\n**ADK A2A Guides**:\n\n- [Introduction to A2A in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/a2a/intro/)\n- [Exposing Agents Quickstart](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/a2a/quickstart-exposing/)\n- [Consuming Agents Quickstart](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/a2a/quickstart-consuming/)\n\n**Other Deployment Options**:\n\n- [Deploy ADK Agents to Cloud Run](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/deploy/cloud-run/)\n- [Deploy to Agent Engine](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/deploy/agent-engine/)\n- [Deploy to GKE](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/deploy/gke/)","metadata":{"id":"Gjs0ZY1YDKyc"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n\n## 📊 Summary - A2A Communication Patterns\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\nIn this notebook, you learned how to build multi-agent systems with A2A:\n\n- **A2A Protocol**: Standardized protocol for agent-to-agent communication across networks and frameworks\n- **Exposing Agents**: Use `to_a2a()` to make your agents accessible to others with auto-generated agent cards\n- **Consuming Agents**: Use `RemoteA2aAgent` to integrate remote agents as if they were local sub-agents\n- **Use Cases**: Best for microservices architectures, cross-team integrations, and third-party agent consumption","metadata":{}}]}
