What languages is the SDK available in ? How does agents started in the field of AI\nhelpful_assistant > The Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) is a flexible and modular framework designed to simplify the creation, deployment, and orchestration of AI agents and multi-agent systems. It applies software development principles to AI agent creation, allowing developers to build production-ready agentic applications with greater flexibility and control. ADK is model-agnostic and compatible with various frameworks, although it is optimized for the Google ecosystem, particularly with Gemini models and Vertex AI.\n\nThe SDK is currently available in the following languages:\n*   **Python**\n*   **Java**\n*   **Go**\n\nThe journey of agents in the field of AI began with simple, rule-based systems in the mid-20th century. These early agents, like ELIZA (a chatbot developed in 1966), were designed to mimic human interaction in limited ways and operated on pre-programmed responses. The 1990s saw the emergence of more intelligent agents capable of making simple decisions autonomously. Advancements in machine learning in the 2000s allowed agents to learn from data and improve their performance. The 2010s brought about the deep learning revolution, significantly enhancing capabilities in areas like image recognition and natural language processing. More recently, the era of \"agentic AI\" has emerged, characterized by systems that operate with greater independence, long-term planning, and collaboration capabilities, moving beyond simple automation to become autonomous problem-solvers.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":8},{"cell_type":"code","source":"response = await runner.run_debug('how to integrate SAP BODS, S4/HANA and Generative AI')","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-11T17:29:28.275567Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-11T17:29:28.276252Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-11T17:29:33.794871Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-11T17:29:28.276222Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-11T17:29:33.793882Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\n ### Continue session: debug_session_id\n\nUser > how to integrate SAP BODS, S4/HANA and Generative AI\nhelpful_assistant > While integrating SAP BODS, S/4HANA, and Generative AI (GenAI) is a complex process, it's achievable through SAP's Business Technology Platform (BTP) and specific AI services. Here's a breakdown of how these components can work together:\n\n**1. SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) as the Foundation:**\nSAP BTP serves as the central hub for integrating GenAI capabilities with SAP systems. It provides the necessary infrastructure, tools, and services to develop, deploy, and manage AI-powered applications.\n\n*   **Generative AI Hub:** This component within BTP offers access to various large language models (LLMs) from different providers (e.g., Google Gemini, Microsoft Azure OpenAI, AWS) and SAP's own foundation models. It facilitates prompt engineering and allows for the selection of the most suitable model for specific use cases.\n*   **SAP AI Core and SAP AI Launchpad:** These services manage the lifecycle of AI scenarios, enabling the deployment and management of AI models and workloads.\n*   **SAP HANA Cloud Vector Engine:** This enables the storage and retrieval of unstructured data in high-dimensional embeddings, enhancing AI models with context and enabling Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines.\n*   **SAP Build Code:** This solution, powered by GenAI, streamlines application development and lifecycle management, including code generation and automation.\n\n**2. Integrating SAP BODS (BusinessObjects Data Services):**\nSAP BODS is primarily used for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL). Its role in a GenAI integration would be to prepare and feed relevant data into the AI models.\n\n*   **Data Preparation:** BODS can extract data from various sources, including S/4HANA, and transform it into a format suitable for AI consumption. This might involve cleaning, enriching, and aggregating data.\n*   **Data Flow to BTP:** The processed data from BODS can then be loaded into SAP HANA Cloud or other data stores accessible by BTP services for AI model training or inference.\n\n**3. Integrating SAP S/4HANA:**\nS/4HANA is the core ERP system containing critical business data and processes. GenAI integration with S/4HANA aims to enhance these processes with intelligent automation and insights.\n\n*   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** GenAI models can query S/4HANA data (often via HANA vector databases) to provide precise, real-time responses to business queries. For example, asking \"Can this sales order be fulfilled by the end of the month?\" and receiving a data-backed answer.\n*   **LLM-Driven SAP API Integration:** GenAI can interact with SAP APIs to autonomously retrieve data, plan business actions (like initiating a production order), and even execute these actions. This allows for intelligent automation of processes such as order management, inventory control, and delivery scheduling.\n*   **Document Processing:** GenAI can process unstructured data from documents (e.g., PDFs) using OCR and LLMs, transforming them into structured formats for easier analysis and integration into S/4HANA processes.\n*   **Conversational Interface:** GenAI enables a \"conversational ERP\" experience, allowing users to interact with S/4HANA using natural language queries for tasks that previously required navigating complex transactions.\n*   **Intelligent Scenario Lifecycle Management (ISLM):** ISLM acts as a bridge between SAP applications and AI runtimes, facilitating the integration and management of AI use cases, including generative AI scenarios.\n*   **ABAP AI SDK:** This SDK allows ABAP developers to build GenAI features directly into custom ABAP applications, connecting to LLMs via SAP AI Core.\n\n**4. Generative AI Use Cases and Benefits:**\n\n*   **Automated Content Creation:** Generating marketing copy, product descriptions, personalized emails, and reports.\n*   **Enhanced Customer Service:** Virtual assistants, intelligent responses to inquiries, and summarizing customer interactions.\n*   **Streamlined Development:** Code generation, explanation, and unit test creation using tools like GitHub Copilot and SAP Build Code.\n*   **Improved Decision-Making:** Predictive analytics, process optimization, and faster insights from data.\n*   **Process Automation:** Automating tasks like invoice matching, order generation, and workflow management.\n*   **Simplifying Implementations:** Generating integration scripts, recommending data mappings, and aiding in troubleshooting.\n\n**Integration Architecture:**\nThe integration typically involves using SAP BTP services to connect S/4HANA and other SAP solutions to GenAI models. Data from BODS can be pre-processed and fed into this ecosystem.
