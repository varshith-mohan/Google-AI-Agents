AI agents are software systems that use AI to pursue goals and complete tasks on behalf of users. They show reasoning, planning, and memory and have a level of autonomy to make decisions, learn, and adapt.


At the core of AI agents are large language models (LLMs). For this reason, AI agents are often referred to as LLM agents. Traditional LLM models, produce their responses based on the data used to train them and are bounded by knowledge and reasoning limitations. In contrast, agentic technology uses tool calling on the backend to obtain up-to-date information, optimize workflows and create subtasks autonomously to achieve complex goals.

In this process, the autonomous agent learns to adapt to user expectations over time. The agent's ability to store past interactions in memory and plan future actions encourages a personalized experience and comprehensive responses.
This tool calling can be achieved without human intervention and broadens the possibilities for real-world applications of these AI systems.
